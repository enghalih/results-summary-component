## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Modules (Scoped styling)
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org) - UI Library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - Build Tool

### What I learned

This project was a great introduction to Vite. I learned how to manage a modern build pipeline and how to maintain a clean project architecture by breaking the interface into modular React components. I focused heavily on understanding how Vite bundles assets and how to manage component-level state effectively.

I also tackled the challenge of dynamic styling by utilizing CSS modules to ensure that specific category colors remained relative to their titles without leaking styles globally.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to focus on:
1. **Industry Standards:** Learning how professional teams organize large-scale React folders and name components.
2. **Advanced CSS:** Refining how I handle relative colors and themes to reduce code repetition.
3. **Accessibility:** Ensuring my dynamic components are fully navigable via keyboard and screen readers.

### AI Collaboration

I collaborated with AI to streamline the following:
- **Refactoring:** Advice on splitting the UI into smaller, logical components.
- **Deployment Debugging:** Resolving issues with `gh-pages` and Vite base paths to ensure the build deployed correctly.
- **English Documentation:** Polishing my submission text for the community.
